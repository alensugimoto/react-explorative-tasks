# React Explorative Tasks

[![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/alensugimoto/react-explorative-tasks)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alensugimoto/react-explorative-tasks/main/LICENSE)

This repository was created to complete two tasks in React.
The purpose of these tasks was to get me started with the
basics of React and prepare for my internship
in the summer of 2021 with [LuCE](https://luce.inf.usi.ch/).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Development

Clone this repository, and see the [available scripts](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/#scripts)
and the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).
